# Taking Board Games Seriously
Programming for Analytics course project

The purpose of this project is to showcase an example of web scrapping using Python and output visiualizing results

Board games can be dull to some, but to others like myself, they can be highly entertaining and taken seriously!
However, there's so many board games out there - how do a board game fanatic find a worthy next game to pick up on?

Let's go look at https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame , it has over a million games on their ranking list!

Using Python, webscrap the attributes, output statistics and visializing results, and determined which top ranked game is overrated and which bottom tail end of the game ranking is underrated and perhaps worthy to try.

Please see project report for further details and the py files separated and commented by their functions.
